# Contributing to pyprod

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **pyprod** 🎉  
pyprod is an open-source project that enables developers to write **InterSystems IRIS Interoperability Productions using purely Python**, while preserving the original Production architecture and behavior.

This document explains the **goals, constraints, and expectations** for contributors.

---

## Project philosophy

pyprod is intentionally opinionated. Any contribution must align with **all** of the principles below.

### 1. Python-first authoring of IRIS Productions
- pyprod allows users to **define and implement IRIS Interoperability Productions in Python**.
- Users should not be required to write ObjectScript as part of normal development.
- The result must still be a real IRIS Production with standard components and behavior.

---

### 2. Zero third-party Python dependencies
- pyprod has **no third-party Python dependencies**, and we do not want them.
- Contributions **must use only the Python standard library**.
- Do not introduce dependencies for convenience, performance, or syntactic sugar.

---

### 3. Accessibility, not reinvention
- The goal is **not** to make IRIS Productions “better” or “more modern.”
- The goal is to make them **accessible to developers who primarily or only know Python**.
- IRIS Productions are treated as a proven system, not something to redesign.

---

### 4. Minimal new code
- Prefer **small, focused changes**.
- Avoid introducing new abstractions unless absolutely necessary.
- If something already exists in IRIS, prefer exposing it rather than recreating it.

---

### 5. No external binding libraries
- Do **not** introduce external libraries for Python ↔ ObjectScript binding.
- The only acceptable runtime dependency is the **IRIS-provided `iris` Python module**.
- Setup should be limited to adjusting the Python path to point to an IRIS installation.

---

### 6. Treat Productions as the underlying “library”
- ObjectScript Productions are treated as the **core system/library**.
- Python code interfaces with that system rather than replacing or emulating it.
- Where needed, pyprod exposes Production concepts to Python users.

---

### 7. Preserve Production architecture
- The **core Production architecture must remain unchanged**.
- The fundamental way Productions are designed, wired, and executed must stay the same.
- Python should not introduce an alternative or simplified mental model.
- Any architectural change must make sense **for both Python and ObjectScript**, not just Python.

---

### 8. Pythonic API design
Python-facing APIs must feel natural to Python developers:

- No `ByRef` or output parameters
- Prefer return values and exceptions
- Objects should be constructed using normal Python initialization
- Favor clear, idiomatic Python over mirroring ObjectScript syntax

---


### 9. Compatibility with modern Python tooling
pyprod should work well with standard Python tooling, including:

- Linters and formatters
- Debuggers
- IDEs and editors

Contributions should not break or bypass these workflows.

---

## What we look for in contributions

Good contributions typically:
- Reduce friction for Python developers using IRIS Productions
- Expose existing Production capabilities more clearly in Python
- Improve correctness, clarity, or maintainability
- Reduce boilerplate without changing semantics

---

## What we will likely reject

We will likely reject contributions that:
- Add third-party Python dependencies
- Redesign or abstract away the Production architecture
- Introduce Python-only concepts that don’t map to Productions
- Attempt to “improve” Productions rather than expose them
- Mimic ObjectScript patterns instead of using Python idioms

---

## Development guidelines

- Keep changes minimal and well-scoped
- Favor clarity over cleverness
- Add comments where IRIS concepts may not be obvious to Python developers
- Avoid speculative or future-facing abstractions

---

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a focused feature or fix branch
3. Make your changes following the principles above
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - A clear description of **what** changed
   - A justification for **why** it aligns with pyprod’s philosophy

---

## Final note

pyprod exists to **bridge skill sets, not rewrite systems**.  
When in doubt, ask:

> “Does this make IRIS Productions more accessible to Python developers *without changing what a Production fundamentally is*?”

If the answer is yes, it’s probably a good contribution.
